The purpose of this License is to make reference books, user manuals or other functional and useful documents in written form free, that is,
to provide everyone with the right to freely copy and distribute, with or without modifications, for a fee or free of charge, these documents.
This License also allows the authors or publishers of a document to preserve their reputations without accepting responsibility for changes made by third parties.

This License is a copyleft license [1]. This means that all works derived from the document must be free in accordance with the concept of "copyleft".
This License supplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

This License is designed to apply to free software documentation, since free software must be accompanied by free documentation. 
The user must have the same rights in relation to the user manual that he has in relation to free software. However, this License does not apply only to the user manual.
This License may apply to any work of text, regardless of its subject matter or whether the work is published in printed book form or not. 
This License is recommended for use for works of a reference or educational nature.
